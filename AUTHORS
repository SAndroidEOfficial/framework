SAndroidE was originally created in late 2016 at University of Brescia, Italy.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made SAndroidE that much better:

    Angelo Vezzoli <angelovezzoli@hotmail.it>
    Giovanni Lenzi <giovanni.lenzi@unibs.it>
    Paolo Bellagente <p.bellagente@unibs.it>
    Claudio Crema <claudio.crema@unibs.it>
